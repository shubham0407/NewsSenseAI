Contextual News Data Retrieval System

This project implements a backend system that processes user queries using Large Language Models (LLMs), retrieves news articles from a database, ranks them using multiple strategies, and returns enriched JSON responses. It simulates real-world news API functionalities, including category filters, text search, proximity search, score-based filtering, source-based filtering, and trending news by location.
